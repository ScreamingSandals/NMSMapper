                        Welcome on the NMS mapping browser page. This page allows you to browse
                        server-side mappings for Minecraft: Java Edition, and compare different mapping types and
                        versions.

                    <p>
                        This page mainly focuses on Spigot, its forks and Spigot-Forge hybrids like MohistMC. That
                        means, that this page doesn't contain information about things excluded in Spigot mappings (e.g.
                        package-info). This page also doesn't contain any information about lambdas, anonymous classes
                        or synthetic members (they are generated by the compiler, they are not in the source code).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the overview page of every version, you can find the licenses for all the mappings and links
                        to their origin.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        If the class or the package name in the history contains ${V}, it means that there should be a
                        CraftBukkit version string (e.g. v1_15_R1, v1_16_R3, ...). If you need the string,
                        please open the version specific page of the class.

                        Website deprecation
                    </h5>

                    <p>
                        In June 2021 with Minecraft 1.17, Spigot's team decided to ditch their member mappings in favor of a Mojang-mapped development environment and obfuscated runtime.
                        This change was unexpected (at least for us), and because we needed to access NMS in our plugins, we've made this project, which allowed us to browse mappings,
                        track the history of individual symbols and automatically generate reflective accessors for multiple versions at once. However, this project has many problems,
                        the biggest one being its memory usage and poor performance, which is getting worse with every single added version.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Therefore, one of us decided to make a <b>new project called <a href="https://github.com/zlataovce/takenaka">
                        <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="currentColor" class="bi bi-github" viewBox="0 0 16 16">

                        &nbsp;takenaka</a></b>.
                        It's a successor to NMSMapper with many new features, such as support to view generics or parameter names, but mainly, it has much better performance than NMSMapper
                        will ever have, so we have decided to deprecate this project in favor of takenaka.
                    </p>

                        <b>Mapping browser</b>
                        <br>
                        If you used NMSMapper to browse mappings, you can easily switch to the new mapping browser generated by takenaka.
                        <b>The new mapping browser is currently hosted on <a href="https://mappings.cephx.dev">mappings.cephx.dev</a></b>
                        and is pretty similar to this one. This browser will be updated for patch versions of 1.20, but then we're going to wave it goodbye completely.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Reflective accessor generator</b>
                        <br>
                        If you used NMSMapper to generate reflective accessors, you will have to adjust your build scripts and source code for takenaka.
                        We understand this can take a lot of time, especially for larger build scripts, so we'll continue updating NMSMapper's generator for as long as you'll need it.
                        Just let us know that you haven't migrated yet, either on our <a href="https://discord.gg/4xB54Ts">Discord</a> server or via <a href="https://github.com/ScreamingSandals/NMSMapper/issues/new">GitHub</a>.
